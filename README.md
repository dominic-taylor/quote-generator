# quote-generator

Similar to my 'mood soother' fun project, except with only one button
and a whole bunch of quotes instead of a video. 
Should be pretty much the same except have one button, linked to a database
of quotes which are picked randomly. 

Connected button to rand num. Ten quotes seems good enough, I'll store them in randQuote()
with a swtich statement. 
Have hooked up the button and the text to appear. Now just need tewn quotes, and styling.
Also had thought I could have used an array of the quotes which are iterated through until the
right one is found and put in. 

Have created the quote generator, just need to work on styling. 
Added title color change with each quote.
